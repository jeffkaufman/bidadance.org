<h1>Band Welcome</h1>

We are pleased to have you play the BIDA dance! For more information
about the BIDA dance series, see <a
href="/"><tt>www.bidadance.org</tt></a>.

<h2>Masking</h2>

We are currently requiring everyone to wear <a
href="https://blog.bidadance.org/2022/05/requiring-high-filtration-masks.html">high-filtration</a>
(N95, KN95, KF94, etc) masks, with the exception of performers while
on stage.

<h2>Timing</h2>

The hall is open at 6. We ask bands to arrive in order to be ready to
start sound check by 6:30. Setup is between 6-6:30, with sound check
from 6:30-7. There is an intro workshop from 7-7:30, which you're not
required to play for. The dance runs from 7:30-10:30. Get dinner
before you come; there are a number of restaurants in Porter Square
and surroundings.  Feel free to ask if you'd like restaurant
recommendations. If youâ€™ll be late, give Jeff a call at 617-871-0237.

<h2>Location</h2>

Most of our dances are held at the Masonic Hall in Porter Square, 1950
Mass Ave, Cambridge. We're opposite the Porter Square stop on the Red
Line if you're coming by transit. If you're coming by car you can park
in the lot next to the hall or (since the dance is on Sunday) in any
metered or residential space for free.  Parking is in the driveway
immediately to the right of the building, in the spots with signs that
say "MASONS PARKING ONLY". The blue doors go to the back of the stage
for load-in.

<h2>Sound</h2>

BIDA will provide a sound system and run sound.  The hall manager will
be at the hall at 6 to meet you. We'll put you in touch with the sound
person before the dance.  Please email that person a list of your
sound needs.

<h2>Finances</h2>

We offer a $100 guarantee + profit sharing per person for up to four
musicians.  Profits are shared equally among all performers and
BIDA. (<a href="/payscale">More details</a>).

<h2>Misc</h2>

We allow sit-ins behind the band, off microphone. They're generally
unobtrusive. <strike>There's a dessert potluck at the break with
popsicles and treats. You don't need to contribute but you are welcome
to partake. It's a good chance to mingle and meet everyone.</strike>
[Food is currently on hold for as long as we'll be requiring masks.]
