This is almost all bare html: if you want to make a change, modify the
relevant HTML file directly.

The exception is the list of upcoming dances, which is in JSON at the
beginning of dances.js.  Don't delete old dances: they're only shown
when someone chooses to display past dances, and it's nice to preserve
the history.

This is deployed with GitHub Pages, and changes go live when you push them.
