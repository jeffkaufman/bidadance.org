<h1>Open Band Leading</h1>

<ul>
  <li><p>Logistics:
      <ul>
        <li>The dance is at the Cambridge Masonic Hall: 1950 Mass Ave
            Cambridge MA.
        <li>We're opposite the Porter Square stop on the Red Line if
            you're coming by transit.  If you're coming by car you can
            park in the lot next to the hall or (since the dance is on
            Sunday) in any metered or residential space for free.
        <li>The dance runs 7:30-10:30 with a ~20min beginners workshop
            ~7:05-7:25 and a ~25min break ~9:05-9:30. 
        <li>The hall opens at 6:00.  Please plan to eat dinner before
            you arrive, and be ready for sound check at 6:45.
        <li>The hall closes at 11:00.
        <li>Pay is $125 for an open band leader, plus potential profit
            sharing.
      </ul>
  <li><p>Anchor musicians:
      <ul>
        <li>Generally open bands go best when there's at least one
            strong rhythm musician and one strong melody musician.
        <li>Often that means the bandleader will anchor rhythm/melody
            and we'll book another anchor musician for the other, but
            we're opening to having two anchors if you feel like that
            would let you concentrate more on leading.
        <li>Typically the leader chooses an anchor they like working
            with, but if you would rather we could find an anchor for
            you.
        <li>Anchor pay is $100/each for one or two people, again plus
            potential profit sharing.
      </ul>
  <li><p>Leading:
      <ul>
        <li>Your role is to make the band sound like something.  Think
            of them as an instrument.  You have so many more options
            with fifteen people than you do with a trio, but you have
            to give them directions.
        <li>Call moods, chords, hits, give solos, give things to
            sections, conduct!
        <li>Being cheesy and over the top is fine, it's an open band,
            no one has a serious musician reputation to maintain.
        <li>If you just play your instrument and try and sound great,
            the band will be boring.  Don't do that.

      </ul>
  <li><p>Tunes:
      <ul>
         <li>We have a tune list (<a
             href="/open-band-tune-list">bidadance.org/open-band-tune-list</a>)
             and generally expect to play all those tunes plus a few
             others picked on the fly.
         
         <li>If there are tunes on that list you don't want to play,
             let us know ahead of time what you'd like to do instead and
             we can include that in the publicity.

         <li>Try to pick repertoire tunes.  It's ok if not everyone
             knows them, but if someone works up a tune to play in the
             open band it's much better if that's then a tune that they'll
             get to play with other people.
         
      </ul>
