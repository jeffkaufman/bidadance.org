<h1>Open Band Leading</h1>

<ul>
  <li><p>Logistics:
      Logistics information and payment info is available <a href="https://www.bidadance.org/band-welcome">here on our band welcome page.</a>
    <li><p>Leading:
      <ul>
        <li>Your role is to make the band sound like something.  Think
            of them as an instrument.  You have so many more options
            with fifteen people than you do with a trio, but you have
            to give them directions.
        <li>Call moods, chords, hits, give solos, give things to
            sections, conduct!
        <li>Being cheesy and over the top is fine, it's an open band,
            no one has a serious musician reputation to maintain.
        <li>If you just play your instrument and try and sound great,
            the band will be boring.  Don't do that.

      </ul>
    <li><p>Anchor musicians:
      <ul>
        <li>Generally open bands go best when there's at least one
            strong rhythm musician and one strong melody musician.
        <li>Often that means the bandleader will anchor rhythm/melody
            and we'll book another anchor musician for the other, but
            we're opening to having two anchors if you feel like that
            would let you concentrate more on leading.
        <li>Typically the leader chooses an anchor they like working
            with, but if you would rather we could find an anchor for
            you.
      </ul>
  
  <li><p>Tunes:
      <ul>
         <li>We have a tune list (<a
             href="/open-band-tune-list">bidadance.org/open-band-tune-list</a>)
             and generally expect to play all those tunes plus a few
             others picked on the fly.

         <li>Try to pick repertoire tunes.  It's ok if not everyone
             knows them, but if someone works up a tune to play in the
             open band it's much better if that's then a tune that they'll
             get to play with other people.

         <li>We would like to update our tune list soon - if there's a repertoire 
             tune you were especially wishing was on the list, 
             please let us know which tune you'd like added. 
         
      </ul>
