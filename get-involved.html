<h1>Get Involved</h1>

<h2>Dancers</h2>

<ul>
  <li><b>Talk to us</b> about creating a workshop, co-hosting an
      event, or hosting a BIDA party.
  <li><b>Volunteer</b> at our dances to keep things running smoothly,
      and get in free!
    <ul>
    <li><p>Most of our dances need someone to set up, 6:15-7:15, and two
        people to greet at the door 6:30-8:00 and 8:00-9:00.
    <li>Write to persis@thorndike.name or join the <a
        href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bida-volunteers">volunteers
        mailing list</a>.
    </ul>
  <li><b>Join our board</b>: we have elections every April, and often
      have vacancies mid-year.  Write to current-bida-board@googlegroups.com to find
      out more.
</ul>

<h2>Safety Representatives</h2>

<ul>
<li><b>We're looking for more people</b> who are interested in helping
  promote dance floor safety at BIDA!
<li><b>If you'd be interested</b> in facilitating a safer dance community and
  are good at conflict resolution, email bida-safety@googlegroups.com for more
  information.
</ul>

<h2>Sound Engineers</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Established Engineers</b> &mdash; Talk to us about running a
      workshop, mentoring new people, or running sound for our dance.

  <li><b>Up and Coming Engineers</b> &mdash; Gain experience by
      helping with sound at one of our dances or attending one of our
      intermediate workshops.

  <li><b>People New To Sound</b> &mdash; Come to one of our
      introductory workshops.

  <li>Email jeff.t.kaufman@gmail.com for more information.
</ul>

<h2>Callers</h2>

<ul>
  <li><b>Established Callers</b> &mdash; Call for our rocking dances!
      Teach from the stage, and help the band and dancers build upon the
      energy in the room, while encouraging dancers to have fun and dance
      with style and grace. Mentor a newer caller to pass along your
      skills, and work with less experienced bands to teach them the
      subtle tricks of the trade.

  <li><b>Up-and-Coming Callers</b> &mdash; We can hook you up with a
      mentor to shadow at their dance, or to observe your calling. Help us
      devise a mentoring situation that will help you!

  <li><b>Brand New Callers</b> &mdash; Call a dance at our parties
      and see how it goes! We’ll provide easy dances to call and a
      more experienced caller to help you out if you need it. Or come
      to a calling workshop, and we’ll get you started!
      
  <li>Email harrislapiroff@gmail.com for more information.
</ul>

<h2>Musicans</h2>

<ul>
  <li><b>Established Musicians</b> &mdash; Get involved as a mentor:
      share your experience and knowledge of dance music traditions to
      help the next generation of dance musicians join the movement!

  <li><b>Emerging Musicians</b> &mdash; Bring your enthusiasm as a
      band or as an individual, and help us create a mentoring experience
      that will help you. If what you need is individual attention from a
      mentor, we can help you find that. If you need experience and
      exposure playing for dances, we can create these opportunities for
      you!

  <li><b>Musicians New to Contra Music</b> &mdash; Come to our jams
      and open bands (<a href="open-band-tune-list">tune list</a>)!
      Gain experience with the traditions, and then let us know when
      you're ready for more!

  <li>Email bida-musician-booking@googlegroups.com for more
      information, or join our <a
      href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bida-musician-announcements">musicians
      mailing list</a>.
