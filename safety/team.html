<h1>Safety Team</h1>

The safety team exists to resolve conflict and increase safety and
comfort in the BIDA dance community through proactive education,
confidential conflict reporting support, and trained mediation. Safety
Team members draft and revise the <a href="/safety">Safety at
BIDA</a> policy, serve as
trained volunteers to handle safety concerns at dances, and respond to
issues pertinent to the team's purview as appropriate.


<p>

The Safety Team prioritizes a rational and fair approach to conflict
resolution. While we take all safety concerns seriously, we reserve
the right to speak with all parties involved in a safety issue in
order to take appropriate actions. We respect the confidentiality of
concerns brought to us and are willing to broach issues with the
subjects of complaints anonymously when appropriate, but we are not
willing to act without first communicating with the problematic party
in some way. Except for the most serious complaints and issues which
have legal aspect, we do not follow a Zero Tolerance policy.

<p>

The Safety Team believes in the ability of individuals to respond to
feedback and regain good standing in community after addressing safety
concerns, but keeps an eye on the progression of actions in order to
ensure that actual progress is being made and is willing to address
continued issues as they arise.

<p>

If you have a safety concern, please contact Safety Team at
<tt>bida-safety@googlegroups.com</tt>.

<p>

If you are uncomfortable contacting the group as a whole, or your
issue concerns a member of Safety Team or a Safety Rep, you could
write to Safety Team members directly:
