<h1>Code of Conduct</h1>

BIDA strives to create and maintain a community environment in which
people are treated with dignity, decency and respect.  Everyone who
comes to BIDA should be able to dance and socialize in a safe and
supportive atmosphere, and this code applies to everyone: board
members, safety team, callers, musicians, and dancers.

<p>

<h2>What should you do?</h2>

<ul>
  <li><p>Practice good communication with other dancers, and be attentive
      to how they're dancing.
  <li><p>Ask questions of your dance partners and people in your
      circle, and respect their answers.  For example:
      <ul>
        <li><p>Dip?
        <li><p>Is it OK if I _____?
        <li><p>Would you like a dancing tip?
        <li><p>How do you feel about ______?
      </ul>
  <li><p>Give and take feedback gracefully.
  <li><p>Check in with people if you notice they might be being made uncomfortable.
</ul>

<h2>What shouldn't you do?</h2>

<ul>

<li><p><b>Don't harass people</b>. That's usually understood to mean
systematic or continued unwanted and annoying actions, including
threats and demands. This can be verbal, physical, or sexual, and none
of it is ok.

<li><p><b>Don't hurt people</b>.  We can be a large crowd in a small
space, and dancers have a wide range of capabilities.  Avoid squeezing
hands, tweaking thumbs, and forceful leading, and keep in mind that
some dancers have injuries that may not be visible.

<li><p><b>Don't make people feel unwelcome</b>.  We love that BIDA has
a wide range of experience levels, and that people come from a variety
of backgrounds.  Not everyone will find the same jokes funny, or have
the same shared context as you.

</ul>
