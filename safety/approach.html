<h1>How We Can Help</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

The Safety Team is here for you: if someone or something is bothering
you, we want to help.  Here's what we can do:

<p>

<ul>
  <li><p>If something needs dealing with right away at a dance, talk to a
      Safety Representative, who will figure out how to address the
      situation.  To find out who's currently on duty as Safety Rep,
      look on the whiteboard on the way in.

  <li><p>If you've got a larger issue, bring it to Safety Team by
      writing to <tt>bida-safety@googlegroups.com</tt> or filling out
      the <a href="/safety-report">Safety Report Form</a>.

  <li><p>If you're uncomfortable talking to the group as a whole, or your
      concern deals with a Safety Team member, you can contact one of
      us individually:

      <p>

      <ul>
        <li>A. Z. Madonna <tt>&lt;zmarmad@gmail.com&gt;</tt>
        <li>Elizabeth Timmerman <tt>&lt;eliz.timmerman@gmail.com&gt;</tt>
        <li>Jeff Kaufman <tt>&lt;jeff.t.kaufman@gmail.com&gt;</tt>
        <li>Lisa Keegan <tt>&lt;lscotkeegan@gmail.com&gt;</tt>
      </ul>
</ul>

<p>

We recognize that Safety Team members and Safety Reps are community
members, and are friends with dancers throughout the contra dance
community. If you find yourself discussing a safety issue informally
with any of us, please make it clear whether or not you expect us to
address the issue formally. That way, we can make sure your concerns
stay confidential, are handled in ways you feel comfortable with, and
are communicated to the rest of Safety Team when appropriate.

<p>

If you have an issue where support from a trained mental health
professional would be helpful, we recommend contacting
<a href="https://tnlr.org/en/">The Network / La Red</a>,
the <a href="https://barcc.org/">Boston Area Rape Crisis Center</a>,
the <a href="https://www.rainn.org/">Rape Abuse Incest National Network</a>, or
<a href="https://www.casamyrna.org/">Casa Myrna</a>.

<h2 id=examples>Example Situations</h2>
<h3>When we might be helpful</h3>
Here are some examples of situations where our Safety Team might be
able to help:

<ul>
  <li>You notice someone keeps staring at you in a way that makes you feel
      uncomfortable.
  <li>Your partner keeps holding your wrist too hard and pushing you into
      flourishes you don't want.
  <li>Someone keeps asking you to dance after you've told them to stop
      asking.
  <li>Someone dips their partner, whose feet come dangerously close to your
      head.
  <li>Someone has abused you, physically, verbally, or emotionally, and
      you're worried they might be dangerous to you or other dancers.
</ul>

In any of these situations it would be reasonable to either bring it
up with the dancer yourself or come talk to us.  People may not be
aware that what they're doing is harmful, and getting feedback from
other dancers can help, but if you don't feel ok talking to them, or
you've tried and they haven't listened, that's what we're here for.

<h3>How we might be helpful</h3>

Here are some hypothetical scenarios, along with how Safety Team
might respond in an effort to resolve the issue:

<p>

<ul>
  <li><p>A dancer has a pattern of pushing others around forcefully, and people
      let Safety Team know that they've been hurt.  The team talks,
      and decides to talk to the offender, ask them to be more gentle,
      and let them know we're considering banning them if they don't
      shape up.  Despite the warnings, they continue injuring the
      people around them.  Safety Team bans the dancer for six months
      and informs the board.
  <li><p>A dancer contacts Safety Team to report that their ex was abusive
      toward them, they would like to avoid being at dances with their
      ex, and they ask Safety Team to ban their ex.  The reporter
      agrees that Safety Team may speak with their ex.  After talking
      with the ex, the team meets again and decides to propose that they
      split the dances: one attending 1st Sunday dances and the other
      attending the 3rd Sunday ones.  A member of the team talks to
      both individually to discuss the proposal.  The ex denies being
      abusive, and they both assert that they shouldn't have to give
      up attending half the dances, but Safety Team stands by the
      proposal: as long the two of them are looking for a solution
      through us, this is the most we can offer.
  <li><p>Safety Team gets a report by a dancer saying that another dancer
      has been harassing them at dances.  Safety Team talks with the
      reporter, and the reporter isn't willing to share any more
      details, have their name disclosed, or let the team talk to the
      offender to get their view.  We decide to keep an eye on the
      offender, watching for negative interactions.  We don't see any,
      but keep a note in case future issues come up.
  <li><p>
      Someone keeps hitting on people at awkward times, like asking
      people out while passing them in line, making lots of other
      dancers uncomfortable.  Some of these dancers let Safety Team
      know, and we have a talk with the offender.  After the offender
      gets a better understanding of how they had been making other
      dancers feel they change their behavior.
  <li><p>A dancer reports a problem where someone keeps
      touching them in unwanted ways: holding them too close in
      swings, "missing" their hand on courtesy turns, and trying to
      hug them after dances.  Safety Team meets with the offender,
      describes the reported behavior, and makes clear that this
      behavior is making the other dancer uncomfortable and that it
      needs to stop.  At the next dance a Safety Rep sees them pushing
      a hug on someone who clearly doesn't want it.  The Safety Rep
      checks with person who just got hugged, who confirms that they
      were trying to pull out of the hug. The Safety Rep asks the
      offender to leave immediately and informs Safety Team.  Before
      the next dance Safety Team meets and agrees to ban the offender,
      informing ther board.
</ul>

<p>

Real situations, however, are more nuanced than can be conveyed in
short paragraphs.  These examples are intended as just that, examples,
and we approach each situation individually.

<p>

While we hope situations like the ones above don't come up at our
dances, we want you to know that we're here for you if they do.

<h2 id=our-approach>Our Approach</h2>

When you bring a report to us, we have two main goals:

<ul>

<li><p><b>Support you</b>: find out what you're looking for from us,
and determine how we can help.

<li><p><b>Protect the community</b>: figure out whether the person
who harmed you is likely to harm others, and if so, figure out how to
prevent or mitigate that harm.

</ul>

<h3 id=supporting-the-reporter>Supporting you</h3>

We'll start by listening to what you want to tell us.  This can be
over text, a call, or in person.  You're welcome to include a friend
for support, as long as they're not a BIDA board member, Safety Team
member, or Safety Rep.

<p>

Our default assumption with anything you tell
us is that it's confidential and for our information only.  The
exception to this is if you tell us about plans to harm yourself or
someone else, in which case we may need to bring in others.

<p>

If we think that it would be helpful for us to get more context by
talking to other people, we'll ask your permission first.

<p>

We'll ask what you're looking for from us, and can describe some
things that have been useful to others in the past.  Often people who
come to us are looking for a way to avoid a person who hurt them.
Some sort of splitting dances can be helpful, which could mean
splitting by:

<ul>
<li>Day: you get 1st Sundays, they get 3rd Sundays.
<li>Time: you get until intermission, they get after intermission.
<li>Space: you get the set by the windows, they get the set by the doors.
</ul>

<p>

If what you're looking for is something we're able to do, we'll work
with you on the details of any proposal before going further with
it.

<h3 id=protecting-the-community>Protecting the community</h3>

When you bring a concern to us, we'll also consider whether this
person might be a danger to others.  We'll want to speak to them and
hear their perspective. We'll also look for evidence of serious
misconduct or long-running patterns of harmful behavior at BIDA or
elsewhere. Your safety still comes first, however, and we won't do
anything that might risk your confidentiality without checking with
you.

<p>

If we find this sort of behavior, there are a range of actions we
could take, up to and including banning someone from BIDA.  A number
of these potential actions are described in the <a
href="#examples">examples above</a>.  In the case of people in
organizational roles, such as board members, callers, musicians, sound
people, Safety Team members, etc, we may ask someone to step down even
if their behavior wouldn't warrant a ban.

<p>

Protecting the community, however, doesn't happen only through
removing people who harm others.  Part of our role is helping
community members learn how to act in ways that support the community
and help everyone feel comfortable.  A major way we do this is by
giving people feedback and holding them accountable.

<h3 id=interpreting-our-actions>Interpreting our actions</h3>

When we propose a split, ban someone, or take another action, this is
not a punishment.  We're trying to find ways to avoid future harm, not
making up for past harm.

<p>

Similarly, if a dancer is affected by a split, it does not necessarily
mean they've done anything wrong.

<p>

We make decisions based on the best information we have, and when new
information comes to light we may revisit past decisions.  As humans,
especially as part-time volunteer humans, we may make mistakes.  If
you feel that we have made a mistake, please let us know so we can
reconsider.
