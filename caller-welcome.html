<h1>Caller Welcome</h1>

<ul>
  <li><p>Logistics:
      <ul>
        <li>The dance is at the Cambridge Masonic Hall: 1950 Mass Ave Cambridge MA
        <li>We're opposite the Porter Square stop on the Red Line if
            you're coming by transit.  If you're coming by car you can
            park in the lot next to the hall or (since the dance is on
            Sunday) in any metered or residential space for free.
        <li>The dance runs 7:30-10:30 with a ~20min beginners workshop
            ~7:05-7:25 and a ~25min break ~9:05-9:30. 
        <li>The hall opens at 6:00.  Please plan to eat dinner before
            you arrive, and be ready for sound check at 6:45.
        <li>The hall closes at 11:00.  Please time the evening,
            including the last waltz, to be done by 10:30 so we have time
            to fully strike.
        <li>Pay is $100, plus potential profit sharing.
      </ul>
  <li><p>Sound:
      <ul>
        <li>We'll provide sound.
        <li>Our caller's mic is a wired mic on a stand.
        <li>If you have a mic you prefer, you're welcome to bring it.
        <li>If you would like a caller monitor let our sound person
            know and they can set you up with one.
      </ul>
  <li><p>Workshop
      <ul>
        <li>The beginner's workshop is scheduled for 7pm to 7:30pm,
            but we like to leave 5min at the beginning for people to
            arrive late and end 5min early to give people time to organize
            themselves and get a drink before the dance starts.
        <li>You can't count on all of the new dancers to arrive in
            time for the workshop, but you'll probably have at least half
            of them.
        <li>If you aren't up for leading the lesson, let us know in
            advance and we'll line up someone else to lead it.
        <li><p>Include:
        <ul>
        <li>Anyone can ask anyone to dance.
        <li>If someone asks you to dance and you don't want to dance
            with them, it's ok to say 'no'. 
        <li>If anyone is bothering you, you can talk to one of our
            "Safety Reps". 
        <li>Flourishes are optional, and teach how to decline them.
        </ul>
      </ul>
  <li><p>Crowd
      <ul>
        <li>Our attendance has been averaging 150, and 75% of the time
            it's between 115 and 180 (<a href="/attendance">chart</a>).
        <li>About 30 of these tend to be completely new to contra this
            evening, and another 40 or so pretty new.
        <li>Our family dances, if you're calling one, tend to have
            about thirty kids and thirty adults, with the kids having
            a median age of ~4.  Prepare lots of easy dances!
        <li><p>We encourage the caller to give  short, light, frequent,
            and humorous messages encouraging etiquette, safety, welcoming
            behavior, and dancing with new people.  Ideas for topics:
            <ul>
              <li>dancing in control
              <li>being aware of other dancers around you
              <li>adjusting your dancing to make your neighbors
                  comfortable
              <li>asking new people to dance
              <li>style suggestions (ouchless allemandes, giving
                  weight, comfortable swings, etc)
              <li>dancing with beginners (guide them into the next
                  move, help without words, don't force embellishments,
                  etc)
            </ul>
      </ul>
  <li id=terms><p>Language
      <ul>
        <li>Our dance is gender-free, and it's common for people
            to dance either role.
        <li>We use "Larks" and "Robins" (or "Ravens") for the role
            names.  The idea  
            is, if the couple is standing together as if they're
            promenading or have just finished a swing, the 'L'ark is
            on the 'L'eft and the 'R'obin is on the 'R'ight.
        <li>Please don't use gendered pronouns, like "his" for Larks.
            If you need to use a pronoun, "they" can work, or you can call
            directly to the dancers with "you".
        <li>We use "right shoulder round" instead of "gypsy".  For
            example, "right shoulder round your neighbor" or "walk around
            your neighbor by the right shoulder". For the (uncommon) move
            traditionally called a "gypsy star" we usually say "facing
            star". 
      </ul>
  <li><p>Dance Choice
      <ul>
        <li>Squares and other formations are welcome, though our crowd
            is mostly not used to them.
        <li>We encourage you to call a mixer during the evening
            to help people meet and dance with new faces.  The third slot
            or somewhere else early in the evening works well for this.
        <li>Since our hall often has 30+ couples per line, unequal
            dances are generally not popular: many people will be
            stuck as 2s for all or most of the dance.
        <li>If you find you're often needing to do more than one
            walkthrough or you're having trouble dropping out by the
            ~6th time through the dance, you've probably chosen dances
            that are to difficult for the crowd and should switch to
            simpler ones. 
        <li>In general we've found less challenging material promotes
            a relaxed environment where people can enjoy the music and
            each other's company.
      </ul>
  <li><p>Misc
      <ul>
        <li>There's a dessert potluck at the break.  You don't have to
            contribute, but you're welcome to eat.
        <li>Partway through one of the dances we turn off the main
            overhead lights and go down to a disco ball and secondary
            lights.  Typically the hall manager coordinates with the band
            to match a tune change.  If you'd like us to also coordinate
            with you, let us know.
        <li>After people have lined up for the last dance of the first
            half but before you've taught the dance we typically have some
            announcements.
      </ul>
