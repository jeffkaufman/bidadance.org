<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

<h2>Contra Dancing FAQ</h2>

<dl>
  <dt>What is contra dancing?
  <dd><p>
      It's super fun but really hard to describe: check out <a
      href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv3lzM0J5ng">this
      video</a>, then come to our dance and give it a try!
      Beginners are always welcome at our dances.

  <dt>I've never contra danced before. What should I bring with
      me?
  <dd><p>
      Enthusiasm!
      <p>
      Wear comfortable clothing and be prepared to sweat some; it's a
      good idea to bring an extra shirt, especially in the summer.
      <p>
      Bring a clean pair of shoes to change into, in order to protect
      the floor. Many dancers prefer suede or leather soles, but
      sneakers are fine&mdash;you don't need anything special, just avoid
      tracking in grit from outside.

  <dt>Where else can I dance!
  <dd><p>

  <dt>What does BIDA stand for?
  <dd><p>Boston Intergenerational Dance Advocates
  <dt>How do you pronounce "BIDA," anyway?
  <dd><p>"BYE-da"
  <dt>Where is your dance and how can I get there?
  <dd><p>We're accessible by public transportation! Most of our dances are held
      at the Cambridge Masonic Hall, <a
      href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/1950+Massachusetts+Ave,+Cambridge,+MA+02140/@42.3895474,-71.1204734,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x89e3773d7bb27eb5:0xafd3af49d0b8f086">1950
      Mass Ave Cambridge</a>, which is less than a block from the
      Porter Square stop on the Red Line. For other public transit
      options try <a
      href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/1950+Massachusetts+Ave,+Cambridge,+MA+02140/@42.3895474,-71.1204734,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x89e3773d7bb27eb5:0xafd3af49d0b8f086">Google
      Maps transit directions</a>. If you prefer to drive, on-street
      parking is free on Sundays, with no permit required.
  <dt>Whaddaya mean, "intergenerational?"
  <dd><p>We want to encourage everyone to socialize and dance with people from
      different generations, in order to share their enthusiasm and
      experience, and to have fun! We think our dance community will benefit
      from breaking down barriers that seem to exist between generations.
      You have all these goals: how do you make them work?
      We hold a variety of different events, some of which focus on certain
      goals more than others. As a whole, we make sure that all of our
      events work towards our primary goal of developing community.
      Our potlucks and parties allow people to socialize informally, and we
      encourage people to wear nametags at our events. We post etiquette and
      dance style posters encouraging everyone to think about how they can
      improve their own dancing and raise the dancing level of the
      community, and we also ask our callers to give style and
      dance-improvement tips from the mic. Our mentoring program cultivates
      opportunities for experienced performers to share their knowledge with
      newcomers, which also strengthens everyone's ties to the
      community.
  <dt>How can I get involved in BIDA?
  <dd><p>Thanks for asking! We'd love to have you get involved. There are lots
      of opportunities available for dancers, musicians, callers, and
      organizers, whatever level of experience or interest you might
      have. Check out our "<a href="/get-involved">Get Involved</a>"
      page for details!
  <dt>How can I start something like this in my area?
  <dd><p>First, figure out what your goals are, and how a new dance
      organization can benefit your community. Then, check out the
      amazing "starter kit" <a
      href="http://www.cdss.org/resources/how-to/organizers-resources">resources</a>
      provided by the Country Dance and Song Society (CDSS). These
      cover all sorts of dance-related topics, and the section on
      organizing community dances is especially helpful if you want to
      start an organization like BIDA. And feel free to email us at
      <tt>current-bida-board@googlegroups.com</tt>. We'll be happy to share any
      experience or ideas that we have, and we are always interested
      in learning about what other groups are doing.
