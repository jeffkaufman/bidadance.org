<h2>Contra Dancing FAQ</h2>

<dl>
  <dt>What is contra dancing?
  <dd><p>
      It's super fun but really hard to describe: check out <a
      href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv3lzM0J5ng">this
      video</a>, then come to our dance and give it a try!
      Beginners are always welcome at our dances.

  <dt>I've never contra danced before. What should I bring with
      me?
  <dd><p>
      Enthusiasm!
      <p>
      Wear comfortable clothing and be prepared to sweat some; it's a
      good idea to bring an extra shirt, especially in the summer.
      <p>
      Bring a clean pair of shoes to change into, in order to protect
      the floor. Many dancers prefer suede or leather soles, but
      sneakers are fine&mdash;you don't need anything special, just avoid
      tracking in grit from outside.

  <dt>Where else can I dance!
  <dd><p>

<h2>BIDA FAQ</h2>
<dl>
  <dt>What does BIDA stand for?
  <dd><p>Boston Intergenerational Dance Advocates
  <dt>How do you pronounce "BIDA," anyway?
  <dd><p>"BYE-da"
  <dt>Where is your dance and how can I get there?
  <dd><p>We're accessible by public transportation! Most of our dances are held
      at the Cambridge Masonic Hall, <a
      href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/1950+Massachusetts+Ave,+Cambridge,+MA+02140/@42.3895474,-71.1204734,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x89e3773d7bb27eb5:0xafd3af49d0b8f086">1950
      Mass Ave Cambridge</a>, which is less than a block from the
      Porter Square stop on the Red Line. For other public transit
      options try <a
      href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/1950+Massachusetts+Ave,+Cambridge,+MA+02140/@42.3895474,-71.1204734,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x89e3773d7bb27eb5:0xafd3af49d0b8f086">Google
      Maps transit directions</a>. If you prefer to drive, on-street
      parking is free on Sundays, with no permit required.
  <dt>Whaddaya mean, "intergenerational?"
  <dd><p>We want to encourage everyone to socialize and dance with people from
      different generations, in order to share their enthusiasm and
      experience, and to have fun! We think our dance community will benefit
      from breaking down barriers that seem to exist between generations.
      You have all these goals: how do you make them work?
      We hold a variety of different events, some of which focus on certain
      goals more than others. As a whole, we make sure that all of our
      events work towards our primary goal of developing community.
      Our potlucks and parties allow people to socialize informally, and we
      encourage people to wear nametags at our events. We post etiquette and
      dance style posters encouraging everyone to think about how they can
      improve their own dancing and raise the dancing level of the
      community, and we also ask our callers to give style and
      dance-improvement tips from the mic. Our mentoring program cultivates
      opportunities for experienced performers to share their knowledge with
      newcomers, which also strengthens everyone's ties to the
      community.
  <dt>How can I get involved in BIDA?
  <dd><p>Thanks for asking! We'd love to have you get involved. There are lots
      of opportunities available for dancers, musicians, callers, and
      organizers, whatever level of experience or interest you might
      have. Check out our "<a href="/get-involved">Get Involved</a>"
      page for details!
  <dt>How can I start something like this in my area?
  <dd><p>First, figure out what your goals are, and how a new dance
      organization can benefit your community. Then, check out the
      great <a
      href="https://cdss.org/resources/resource-portal/?_sft_post_tag=starting-up">resources</a>
      provided by the Country Dance and Song Society (CDSS). These
      cover all sorts of dance-related topics, and the section on
      organizing community dances is especially helpful if you want to
      start an organization like BIDA. And feel free to email us at
      <tt>current-bida-board@googlegroups.com</tt>. We'll be happy to share any
      experience or ideas that we have, and we are always interested
      in learning about what other groups are doing.
  <dt>Does BIDA have bylaws?
  <dd><p>Yes! Have fun reading through <a href="bylaws">them</a>.
  <dt>What do you tell callers and bands about your dance, to let them know what to
      expect?
  <dd><p>Check out our <a href="caller-welcome">caller</a> and <a href="band-welcome">band</a> welcome pages.
  <dt>Can I come and play for the dance?
  <dd><p>Sure!
  <ul>

  <li><p>We hold open bands about once a quarter, both for the evening
  dance and for our family dances.  People of any level are welcome to
  come and play.  The family dance open bands are lower-key, playing
  easier tunes from the floor without amplification, while the evening
  dance open bands play mroe difficult music and close-mic many of the
  musicians.  To learn when these are happening, sign up for our <a
  href="https://groups.google.com/g/bida-musician-announcements">musicians
  mailing list</a>.

  <li><p>If you'd like to be booked to play for BIDA, write to
  <tt>bida-musician-booking@googlegroups.com</tt>.  While there are a
  lot more people who would like to play BIDA than we have spots for,
  we are especially looking for musicians who are ready to play a big
  dance but don't have enough of a track record for more risk-averse
  dances.

  </ul>

  <dt>What tunes do you play at your open bands?
  <dd><p>Check out our <a href="open-band-tune-list">open band tune
      list</a>.
  <dt>How much does BIDA pay people for things?
  <dd><p>Our pay rates are <a href="payscale">public</a>.  For
  performers we offer guarantees and an attendance-based bonus.

  <dt>Is your dance wheelchair accessible?  Are you fragrance-free?</dt>
  <dd><p>See our <a href="/accessibility">accessibility information.</a></dd>

  <dt>How many dancers do you tend to get?</dt>
  <dd><p>About 175, but it varies (<a href="/graphs#attendance">chart</a>).</dd>

  <dt>What do your finances look like?</dt>
  <dd><p>Most of the time we make a bit of money, some of which goes
  to th band and caller as an attendance bonus and the rest we keep for
  dances that lose money (<a
  href="/graphs#financials">chart</a>).</dd>

  <dt>Can I make an announcement at a dance?</dt>
  <dd><p>Because there are so many events that one could plausibly
  announce at our dances we have a pretty strict announcements policy,
  where we only announce BIDA events.  Additionally, the evening's
  performers may announce other opportunities to see them perform.

  <dt>Do you cancel the dance for snow?</dt>
  
  <dd><p>We are fortunate to be in an area with many dancers,
  musicians, and callers within walking and public transit distance.
  We will generally still hold the dance unless the hall cancels on us
  or the red line shuts down.  If we do cancel we'll send an email to
  the <a
  href="https://groups.google.com/g/bida-announcements">bida-announcements</a>
  group.
