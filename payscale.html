<h1>Payscale</h1>

<ul>
<li>Caller: $150, plus potential attendance bonus
<li>Musician: $150/each with a max of $600/band, plus potential attendance bonus
<li>Sound: $100
<li>Open band leader: $175
<li>Open band anchor: same as standard musicians
<li>Open band sound: if only one person is running sound for the
    evening, extra $40
<li>Family dance caller / musician: $75 (regardless of whether they're
    also doing the evening dance)
<li>Hall manager: $15/session ($30/evening)
</ul>

<p>

We also pay an attendance-based bonus to each performer, which varies
based on our financial situation. As of 2024-08-10, we pay $2.00 for
every attendee over 120.  This has recently averaged $135/performer,
with a high of $285 and a low of $0. You can see our attendance range
on our <a href="https://www.bidadance.org/graphs">graphs page</a>.

<p>

For bands with over four people, we pay as if for a four person band but divide
more ways.  For example, if there were 200 attendees then any band with 4+
musicians would receive $600 total in guarantees (4 * $150) and $640 total in
attendance bonus (4 * $2 * (200-120)) for a total of $1,240.  For a four person
band that would be $310/each; for a six person band it would be $207/each.

Sheet</a> which we fill out at each dance.
