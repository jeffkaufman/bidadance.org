<h1>Accessibility</h1>

<h2>Covid</h2>

As of 2023-05-24:

<ul>

<li><p>Everyone at the dance must be boosted, if eligible.
<ul>
<li>If you're not yet eligible, due to age or time
    since your previous shot, that's fine.
<li>Boosters beyond the first are not required.
<li>We check cards at the door (photos ok).
<li>If your doctor has advised you not to get some or all of your
    shots, or not get them yet, that's ok. Please either email your
    doctor's note to bida@bidadance.org or bring it with you to the
    dance.
</ul>

<li><p>Please notify us after if you learn you may have been
infectious at the dance.  Without giving your name we'll let the
community know by posting on Facebook, updating our website, and
emailing everyone who asked to be notified.

<li><p>Everyone age two and up must wear a <a
href="https://blog.bidadance.org/2022/05/requiring-high-filtration-masks.html">high-filtration</a>
(N95, KN95, KF94, etc) mask, except when (a) actively drinking or
(b) performing on stage.  If you need to eat, please do so outside.

</ul>

<p>

As of 2023-05-21 we've resumed our potlucks.  People are welcome to
eat outside or inside.  If you're eating inside, please wear your mask
when you're not eating.

<h2>Mobility</h2>

<h3>Cambridge Masonic Hall</h3>

The Masonic Hall is not wheelchair accessible. To get in the front
entrance, there are nine stairs up to the door and then sixteen down
to the hall where the dance is. There is also a locked side door, with
eight stairs down to the hall. To reach a volunteer who can let you in
the side door, please call 617-871-0237.  If assistance would be
helpful, we can get people together for that as well.

<p>

The stage is on a higher level from the dancing, four steps up from
the hall and four steps down from the side door.

<p>

There are two small all-gender bathrooms, not really practical for
wheelchairs, on the same level as the dancing.

<h3>Somerville Armory</h3>

The Somerville Armory is wheelchair accessible.  There is a ramp from
street level to the door, and then everything we use is on a single
level.  This includes two large all-gender bathrooms, which each have
a handicap stall.

<h2>Lighting</h2>

<h3>Regular Dances</h3>

At our regular 1st and 3rd Sunday dances at the Masonic Hall there is
a disco ball.  We typically reduce light levels and turn on the ball
about halfway through the evening, during one of the dances.  If you
want to know when this will be, ask at the door to talk to the hall
manager.

<h3>Spark in the Dark</h3>

At our occasional Spark in the Dark dances we have much lower light
levels, moving colored lights, and blacklights.  We don't use strobes
or smoke machines.

<h2>Public Transit</h2>

The Masonic Hall is on the Red Line, Fitchburg Line, and the 77, 83,
87, and 96 buses.  The Armory is on the 88 and 90 buses.  All of these
buses and trains are wheelchair accessible.  For detailed directions
and schedules Google Maps works well: <a
href="https://goo.gl/maps/3usvVVZjUZ22">Cambridge Masonic Hall</a>, <a
href="https://goo.gl/maps/wHufZwaceW72">Somerville Armory</a>.

<h2>Seating</h2>

All of our dances have chairs along the edge where you can sit, talk,
hang out, etc if you don't feel like dancing.

<h2>Allergies</h2>

Our regular dances have a dessert potluck at the break, and our family
dances have a dinner potluck between the family dance and the regular
dance.  We don't have restrictions on what people can bring, and this
often includes nuts and other common allergens.

<p>

As of 2022-09-21 we have temporarily suspended the potluck due to
covid.

<h2>Fragrances</h2>

We don't have a fragrance policy, and some people (disproportionately
newer dancers) wear cologne/perfume.

<h2>Photography</h2>

We don't have a photography policy, and it is common for dancers to
take pictures or videos and post them on social media.

<h2>Financial</h2>

All our dances are sliding scale, on a pay what you can basis.  If you
can't afford to pay at least our minimum, let us know in advance and
we're happy to have <a
href="https://blog.bidadance.org/2013/11/volunteers-wheels-that-make-bida-run.html">volunteers</a>.
You can join our <a
href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bida-volunteers">volunteer
mailing list</a> to get notified when we're looking for people for
upcoming dances.

<p>

If you show up asking to volunteer without talking to us in advance we
may be able to find a role for you, but we also may not.  So please
write to us ahead of time so we can coordinate!
