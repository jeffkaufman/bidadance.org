<h2 id=covid>Airborne Infections</h2>

As of 2025-11-01:

<ul>

<li><p>We host both <strong>mask-required</strong> and <strong>mask-optional</strong> dances.
The policy for each dance will be announced in advance on the website, email list, and social media.

<li><p>At mask-required dances, everyone age two and up must wear a <a
href="https://blog.bidadance.org/2022/05/requiring-high-filtration-masks.html">high-filtration</a>
(N95, KN95, KF94, etc) mask, except when (a) actively drinking or
(b) performing on stage.

<li><p>We will provide high-filtration masks at the door for all dances.

<li><p>Family dances and potlucks are always mask-optional.

<li><p>Most other pre-dance events will follow the same masking policy
as the regular dance they precede. Exceptions and other special events
will have their own policies which will be announced in advance.

<li><p>Please notify us after if you learn you may have been
infectious at the dance.  Without giving your name we’ll let the
community know by posting on the website and emailing our
<a href="https://www.bidadance.org/join">covid notification list</a>.

<li><p>We recommend that dancers stay up to date with covid and flu
vaccines, but we do not require them.

<li><p>We use <a

<h3>Cambridge Masonic Hall</h3>

The Masonic Hall is not wheelchair accessible, but there is a seated
stair lift down from the side door.  To reach a volunteer who can let
you in and operate the lift, please call the number written on our
sign outside, or 617-871-0237 (Jeff) if you can't find that.

<p>

<img src="media/bida-chair-lift-folded.jpg">

<p>

The seat, footrest, and armrests fold down:

<p>

<p>

The lift is operated by a little grey knob on the right arm rest,
which you push in the direction you'd like it to move.

<p>

At the top it can be rotated towards the entrance by pulling the black
levers upwards on either side of the seat:

<p>

<p>

To get in the front entrance, there are nine stairs up to the door and
then sixteen down to the hall where the dance is.

<p>

The stage is on a higher level from the dancing, four steps up from
the hall and four steps down from the side door.

<p>

There are two small all-gender bathrooms, not really practical for
wheelchairs, on the same level as the dancing.

<h3>Somerville Armory</h3>

The Somerville Armory is wheelchair accessible.  There is a ramp from
street level to the door, and then everything we use is on a single
level.  This includes two large all-gender bathrooms, which each have
a handicap stall.

<h2 id=lighting>Lighting</h2>

<h3>Regular Dances</h3>

At our regular Sunday dances at the Masonic Hall there is
a disco ball.  We typically reduce light levels and turn on the ball
about halfway through the evening, during one of the dances.  If you
want to know when this will be, ask at the door to talk to the hall
manager.

<h3>Spark in the Dark</h3>

At our occasional Spark in the Dark dances we have much lower light
levels, moving colored lights, and blacklights.  We don't use strobes
or smoke machines.

<h2 id=transit>Public Transit</h2>

The Masonic Hall is on the Red Line, Fitchburg Line, and the 77, 83,
87, and 96 buses.  The Armory is on the 88 and 90 buses.  All of these
buses and trains are wheelchair accessible.  For detailed directions
and schedules Google Maps works well: <a
href="https://goo.gl/maps/3usvVVZjUZ22">Cambridge Masonic Hall</a>, <a
href="https://goo.gl/maps/wHufZwaceW72">Somerville Armory</a>.

<h2 id=seating>Seating</h2>

All of our dances have chairs along the edge where you can sit, talk,
hang out, etc if you don't feel like dancing.

<h2 id=allergies>Allergies</h2>

Our family and double dances generally have potlucks. We don't have
restrictions on what people can bring, and this often includes nuts
and other common allergens.

<h2 id=fragrances>Fragrances</h2>

We don't have a fragrance policy, and some people (disproportionately
newer dancers) wear cologne/perfume.

<h2 id=photography>Photography</h2>

We don't have a photography policy, and it is common for dancers to
take pictures or videos and post them on social media.

<h2 id=financial>Financial</h2>

All our dances are sliding scale, on a pay what you can basis.  If you
can't afford to pay at least our minimum, let us know in advance and
we're happy to have <a
href="https://blog.bidadance.org/2013/11/volunteers-wheels-that-make-bida-run.html">volunteers</a>.
You can join our <a
href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bida-volunteers">volunteer
mailing list</a> to get notified when we're looking for people for
upcoming dances.

<p>

If you show up asking to volunteer without talking to us in advance we
may be able to find a role for you, but we also may not.  So please
write to us ahead of time so we can coordinate!
