  <li>Meetings of the Membership

      <ol type=i>
        <li>The annual meeting of the membership will be held in the month of April.</li>
        <li>Additional membership meetings may be called at any time by a majority vote of the Board.</li>

        <li>At the annual membership meeting, Officer and at-large Board member elections will be done by a silent, blind, vote. Members will be able to vote for any number of people to join the Board, and the seven candidates with the most votes will become members of the Board. BIDA will use any method of vote-counting that its Board approves. Anyone may be nominated for any position at any time, subject to the nominee's approval, up to one week before the annual membership meeting, at which point nominations will close. The Board will decide by consensus which members will take which officer positions. All officer and Board terms shall be for one year, starting on May 1.</li>
        <li>BIDA's annual membership meeting requires 2/3 of the BIDA board to be present but there will be no membership quorum requirement for the transaction of its business.</li>
        <li>If the annual meeting of the membership cannot happen on the announced date, it will be postponed until the next BIDA-sponsored event after the originally scheduled date. The term of the incoming board will run from the day after the election through the last day of April, and the term of the outgoing board will be extended until the term of the new board begins.</li>
        <li>If, at the time the annual membership meeting is scheduled to begin, seven or fewer people have been nominated to join the BIDA board, instead of voting all nominees will join the board.</li>
        <li>If, at the time the annual membership meeting is scheduled to begin, all nominees are currently members of the BIDA board, instead of voting all nominees will join the board.</li>
      </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Meetings of the Board
      <ol type=i>
        <li>The Board of Directors will meet at least twice a year. Any additional meetings may be called by any board member, and must be seconded, with at least two weeks' notice given.</li>
        <li>The Board may make any decision by a vote of two-thirds of its members.</li>
        <li>Board meetings will have a quorum of two thirds of at-large members and Officers.</li>

<h2>Article VIII: Amendments to these Bylaws</h2>
<p>Any changes or amendments to these Bylaws must pass a two-thirds vote of the BIDA membership at a membership meeting. Any proposed changes or amendments must be distributed electronically to membership at least one month prior to the vote.</p>
<h2>Article IX: Special Notices re Tax Exemption</h2>
<ol type=A>

  <li>It is intended that BIDA be entitled to exemption from Federal income tax under section 501(c)3 of the Internal Revenue Code and shall not be a private foundation as described in section 501(a) of the Code.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Addendum: Feminist Process</h2>
<p>Feminist Process is a way of running meetings that does not reinforce typical power structures the way Robert's Rules of Order does. It's intended to give everybody a voice. It's aimed at reaching consensus on all issues, rather than reaching a vote.
